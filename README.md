# Machine Learning Internship Tasks
This repo contains notebooks for Machine learning tasks for my Elevvo Internship Program using Python.  
Each notebook can be opened and executed directly in Google Colab.

## Tasks
### [Task 1: Student Score Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wnk5-ELlYU9IxXi3RLWXtq0UP01JqpUv?usp=sharing)
